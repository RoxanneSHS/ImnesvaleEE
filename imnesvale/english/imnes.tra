@1  = ~Who are you? It matters not, I have come to conquer this miserable town. Just a short stop on my road to the conquest of Amn. Bow down before your new master and I may spare your wretched lives.~
@2  = ~Um. Do you have any idea who we are? Or are you just another stupid megalomaniac? I'm guessing the latter.~
@3  = ~Uh. Hi there.~
@4  = ~God, not another one. Is there something in the water or do I just attract lunatics?~
@5  = ~What? The worm wishes to address me? Go ahead pathetic one.~
@6  = ~Damn, why, why, why, me? Are you going to leave peacefully, or do I have to break your skull?~
@7  = ~Uh. What can we help you with?~
@8  = ~You. Dare. To. Insult. Me?! Ha! I shall not sully my blade with the blood on one as wretched as you. Fall to my minions!~
@9  = ~Oh get lost.~
@10  = ~They all said I was insane, but I'll show them.... I will prove that my theory that our universe is nothing more then a grain of sand on an infinite beach! Um. Yeah, well, I'll just be leaving now.~
@11 = ~I think I'm going to cry.~
@12 = ~You wish my life story? Very well. Well, for starters I was born in..~
@13 = ~Actually, I didn't ask for your life story, I just asked what the hell your doing here. Just so I know whether or not to kill you.~
@14 = ~Um. I hate to interrupt, but can we cut this short and get to the violent part?~
@15 = ~Oh. But don't you want to hear the tragic story of my past?~
@16 = ~No, not really. I'm just going to kill you after all, what do I care about your tragic past?~
@17 = ~*sigh* I suppose so. It's not like I have anything better to do, like saving an elven city from a psychotic madman for example.~
@18 = ~Very well puny one. Pray to your gods before I crush you.~
@19 = ~Right. Lets get violent!~
@20 = ~Very well, it all began during the Time of Troubles when the gods walked the earth. As you may or may not know, the dead god Bhaal sired a number of children with mortals to aid in his resurrection. I am one of those children, my mother was a powerful mage in the service of one of Bhaal's temples. When the time came for me to be sacrificed, my mother couldn't bear it, and spirited me away.~
@21 = ~And I care..... why?~
@22 = ~Oh, another of my siblings with moronic dreams of conquest.~
@23 = ~Silence mortal! Allow your betters to speak. Ahem. Now, as I was SAYing my mother spirited me away, but was badly injured in the attempt. She died not long after, leaving me, a small child, alone in this cruel cruel world.~
@24 = ~Well, I've had enough of this sob story. Time to die.~
@25 = ~Please, go on, it sounds like you had a horrible childhood.~
@26 = ~You dare to patronize me?!? Do you have any idea who you are messing with? Die impudent one!~
@27 = ~Whoops, I should have seen that one coming.~
@28 = ~You have slain my son, now I shall deal with you personally, prepare to suffer an eternity of torment!~
@29 = ~Who cares, we're going to butcher each other anyway.~
@30 = ~Not at all, we did just chop your son into tiny weenie bits. And your next.~
@31 = ~Please, you must protect our poor village my <LADYLORD>! A evil mage has been taking over small villages to the north of here. He turns the population into slaves for his ever-growing army! I shall stay here and organize our defences. The others have already gathered inside the inn.~
@32 = ~Of course good mayor.~
@33 = ~I don't think so, you guys are on your own.~
@34 = ~Once again you come to us in our hour of need, my <LADYLORD>. Please remember, if either my wife or I are slain, our meagre defences will crumble and all will be lost. Protect us at all costs. ~
@35 = ~Of course mayor. Fear not.~
@36 = ~Please my <LADYLORD>, without you we wont stand a chance!~
@37 = ~Very well, but I expect to be rewarded very well.~
@38 = ~I guess you don't stand a chance do you?~
@39 = ~Very well. Then we accept our fates, and may the gods strike you down for what you have done.~
@40 = ~Ha. I make my own fates, the gods desires notwithstanding.~
@41 = ~Jugend draws power from one of his subordinates. He is fully healed!~
@42 = ~Jugend tries to draw power from one of his subordinates, but you have slain both!~
@43 = ~There goes the mayor.~
@44 = ~Cry? Hold on, I think I have a handkerchief here somewhere...~
@45 = ~He rummages through a very large backpack....~
@46 = ~Wait! You're trying to trick me! I don't own a handkerchief! Now my minions shall destroy you.~
@47 = ~Can't I ever fight a SANE bad guy? I mean, is that too much to ask?~
@48 = ~Wait, don't tell me you're another bunch of goody two shoes, always interfering with the grand plans of a Bhaalspawn like myself. Well, regardless, I'm taking over this town! And for once evil has a decent chance to win!~
@49 = ~Now my <LADYLORD> let me tell you what I have learned about our attackers......~
@50 = ~They are led by a powerful mage called Jugend. He has two lieutenants, a mage named Ayrus and a mage called Maia. They each lead a section of his army. His son leads the third section. Beware his son, he is a powerful fighter and not to be trifled with.~
@51 = ~Supposedly his army is almost without end, but in order for him to continue bringing in reinforcements, his two lieutenants and his son have to hold open portals.~
@52 = ~By killing his son you will close the lower two portals, and by killing his lieutenants you will close the three upper portals.~
@53 = ~We have gathered a bit of information about Jugend's army that I may share with you.~
@54 = ~Sure.~
@55 = ~Fear nothing, we have some experience with such guys.~
@56 = ~Also, those who you have aided in the past will come to aid you. Use them well. We have only a few minutes before they attack.~
@57 = ~Understood.~
@58 = ~Good luck then my <LADYLORD>, we only have a few minutes before they attack.~
@59 = ~Ahhh!!~
@60 = ~We have come to fulfil our part of the bargain. We will help protect the village. Tell us what to do.~
@61 = ~Great. Thank you for your help, Madulf.~
@62 = ~Greetings protector of the forest. The spirits of the forest have come to aid you against the evil that threatens the land.~
@63 = ~All help is appreciated. The coming fight will be extremely tough.~
@64 = ~A spell trigger is fired!~
@65 = ~A contingency is triggered!~
@66 = ~No! You WILL die!~
